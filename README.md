# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Ruby on Rails Development

An [instruction file](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_custom-instructions) for GitHub Copilot containing best practices and well known patterns for a better AI assisted coding experience, tailored using personal preferences and past experiences.

I tried to keep the contents as generic as possible, allowing different developer preferences to be supported, and tried to avoid pushing the agent to a certain style of development. However it is possible that some of the instructions may not be suitable for all developers or projects.

## How to Use

Copy the [instructions/ruby-on-rails.instructions.md](instructions/ruby-on-rails.instructions.md) file into your `.github/instructions/` folder in your repository.
The file will be automatically picked up by GitHub Copilot and used to guide the AI's suggestions when you are working on ruby files (`.rb`).
